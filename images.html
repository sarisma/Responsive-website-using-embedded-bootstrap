            Queen commenced the News of the World Tour in November 1977, and Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times
            called this concert tour the band's

            The album contained many songs tailor-made for live performance, including two of rock's most recognisable
            anthems, "We Will Rock You" and the rock ballad
            "We Are the Champions",

          <p class="card-text">After fans noticed Mercury's increasingly gaunt appearance in 1988, the media reported
            that Mercury was seriously ill, with AIDS frequently mentioned as a likely illness. Mercury denied this,
            insisting he was merely "exhausted" and too busy to provide interviews; he was now 42 years old and had been
            involved in music for nearly two decades. Mercury had in fact been diagnosed as HIV positive in 1987,
            but did not make his illness public, with only his inner circle of colleagues and friends aware of his
            condition.
